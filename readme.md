# Text Highlighter :book: :pen:
Made by Rannyeri Baptist for an application test at https://www.thymebase.com/. :rocket:

## Running the project :gear:
To run the project, the only thing you need installed in your system is Ruby. If you need to install it check [this](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) guide.

After installing Ruby in your machine, just clone this repo anywhere in your system and navigate to the root path of the project and run the following command in your command prompt.

```
$ ruby highlighter.rb
```

 That's it! When the script finishes, it will automatically create a HTML file in the same directory of the highlighter script, so you can see the results.

To change the outcome, you can simply open the `highlighter.rb` file in your favorite text editor and change the text variable in the top of the file, and/or the highlights variable.

Enjoy ;)
